Rationale
=========

Why this architecture? Why configuration management? What is it worth to me as a
service owner? -- Here I will try to provide some answers to these questions.

Goals
-----

The whole idea is to make deployment of the service as easy and hands-off as
possible. We can leverage the required migration to the Agile Infrastructure to
help achieve this. We want to be able to make the deployment (and therefore the
recovery if something goes wrong) as automated as it can be.

How? Read on...

Methods
-------

In an ideal world deploying a service would be as simple as installing a
package, it would bring along with it all of its dependencies and configuration.
This, however, is not a practical goal for many smaller software packages. The
next best thing is to help define these dependencies in a semi-formal way, which
conveniently can be configuration management (like Puppet) templates.
